# 👋🏻 Hello!

I'm a Software Developer and a tech enthusiast based in Barcelona, Spain. My area of expertise involves building backend services in a distributed, scalable, and resilient way. I've worked in Agile teams developing software for high-concurrency environments.

I've written a set of lists so you can get to know me better without having to read too much, but feel free to email me to schedule a call anytime.

# 👨🏻‍💻 Tech

I feel comfortable with:

- Scala (Cats, Play Framework, FS2, http4s) —alternatively, Kotlin or Java
- PHP (Symfony, PSR)
- Functional Programming
- DDD, CQRS & Ports and adapters architecture
- MySQL & Redis
- AWS (DynamoDB, Aurora, EKS, SNS & SQS)
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Unit, integration, and acceptance testing

And I'm up to adopt new technologies such as Rust or Go.

# 🚧 Experience

Part of the **Growth squad** teaming up with different specialists (Mobile, QA, Design, Product and Management). I was in charge of developing marketing and retention campaigns. Successfully delivered millions of pushes and emails, and helped the company reach the OKRs. The company's **userbase was 100M+** by that time.

  <summary><b>Technical details</b></summary>
  
  >We ran up to 8 event-driven microservices (Scala, most of them) in a Kubernetes AWS cluster. The high-concurrency environment required a scalable and resilient architecture. We chose CQRS architecture for all our consumers and RESTful APIs.

  <sub><b>Stack:</b> Scala, PHP, Play Framework, Cats, Symfony, http4s, FS2, AWS (DynamoDB, Aurora, EKS, SNS & SQS), MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Terraform, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Grafana, New Relic, Kibana, GitHub, Jira, Confluence.</sub>

I was in charge of the development and maintenance of a series of Spanish **well-known entertainment websites** such as Asco de Vida, Memedeportes, Así va España, Urbanian, or Cribeo. I also worked on the remake of ContaHogar, a personal finance webapp. I had the chance to dig into **web development as a whole**.

<details>
  <summary><b>Technical details</b></summary>
  
  >We built a custom PHP framework that allowed us to rapidly launch new websites. Successfully transitioned from classic mid-2000s websites to HTML5 and responsive/adaptive design. We put a lot of emphasis on mastering the HTTP protocol and browsers in order to shorten page load times.

  <sub><b>Stack:</b> PHP, HTML, CSS (LESS), Javascript (jQuery, Typescript & ES6), SVN.</sub>
</details>

Before that, I worked on smaller companies developing websites and as an IT technician (HelpDesk).
