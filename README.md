# üëãüèª Hello!

I'm a Software Developer and a tech enthusiast based in Barcelona. My area of expertise involves building backend services in a distributed, scalable and resilient way. I've worked in Agile teams developing software for high-concurrency environments.

I've written a set of lists so you can get to know me better without having to read too much, but feel free to email me to schedule a call anytime.

# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Tech

I feel comfortable with:

- Scala (Cats, Play Framework, FS2, http4s) ‚Äîalternatively, Kotlin or Java
- PHP (Symfony, PSR)
- Functional Programming
- DDD, CQRS & Ports and adapters architecture
- MySQL & Redis
- AWS (DynamoDB, Aurora, EKS, SNS & SQS)
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Unit, integration and acceptance testing

And I'm up to adopt new technologies such as Rust or Go.

Part of the **Growth squad** teaming up with different specialists (Mobile, QA, Design, Product and Management). I was in charge of developing marketing and retention campaigns.
